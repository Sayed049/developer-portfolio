            <h3>Dream Big with Low Skill</h3>
            <p>I am a quick learner, punctual, hard worker, flexible and adaptable according to situations and most
                importantly, I am always keen to learn new things whenever I get a chance. My short term goal (until I
                have
                completed my graduation) is to join a company where not only I can utilize my skills and knowledge, but
                also
                I will get a learning environment to boost my career. I also believe in spending more time to fix our
                faults
                than thinking about that.</p>
